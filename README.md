# Cybersecurity Blue Team Portfolio

Welcome! This repository documents my journey into cybersecurity as I build the foundational skills needed for **Blue Team**, **SOC Analysis**, **Incident Response**, and **Threat Detection**. I'm currently a beginner with no prior experience - this portfolio tracks my growth through hands-on labs, notes, and self-directed projects.

---

## About Me
I'm an aspiring **Blue Team / SOC Analyst** passionate about defending systems, analyzing threats, and learning how security operations work. I'm building skills through home labs , security tools, and continuous learning.

**Interests:**
- SOC Analysis
- Detection Engineering
- Incident Response
- Windows and Linux Security
- Threat Intelligence

---

**Skills I'm Developing
Beginner but growing every week:

### Operating Systems
- Windows 10/11,
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

### Blue Teamm Skilld
- SIEM log analysis (Splunk, Wazuh, Elastic)
- Endpoint Monitoring
- System Hardening
- Threat Hunting Basics
- Log interpretation (Windows Event Logs, Sysmon, Linux logs)

### Network Basics
- TCP/IP
- Ports and protocols
- Packet capture analysis (Wireshark)

### Security Knowledge
- MITRE ATT&CK familiarity
- Common attacks (bruteforce, phishing, malware basics)
- CIA Triad and security concepts

---

## Learning Roadmap
This roadmap guides what I'm learning and what projects will appear in this portfolio.

### **Phase 1 - Foundations**
-Network fundamentals
Windows and Linux basics
Security fundamentals

### **Phase 2 - Blue Team Tools**
- Install and use Splunk, Wazuh, Elastic
- Learn log analysis
- Build dashboards and queries

### **Phase 3 - Practical Blue Team Projects**
- Build a home SOC lab
- Analyze packet captures
- Create detection rules
- Write practice incident reports

# Projects

Even as a beginner, I'm building hands-on practice. Each folder in this repository contains documentation, screenshots, and analysis.

---

## Home SOC Lab (In Progress)
**Folder:** `/home-soc-lab`

A simple Blue Team setup using virtual machines and a SIEM.
Includes:
- Lab diagram
- VM setup and network plan
- SIEM configuration
- Screenshots of logs flowing in

**Skils:** SIEM setup, logging, basic monitoring.

---

## SIEM Log Analysis (Beginner Friendly)
**Folder:** 1/siem-log-analysis`

Example exercise include:
- Detection failed logins
- Detecting Powershell execution
- Identifying suspicious processes
- Writing basic queries (SPL or EQL)

**Skills:** querying, log interpretation, detection mindset.

---

## Packet Capture (PCAP) Analysis
**Folder:** `/wireshark-analysis`

Includes:
- Sample PCAP analysis
- Port scan detection
- DNS anomaly review
- Common Wireshark filters used

**Skills:** network analysis, packet inspection.

---

## Windows and Linux Hardening
**Folder:** `/system-hardening`

Documentation of security improvements:
- Password, audit, and firewall policies
- Logging enchancement (Sysmon on Windows)
- Service review
- Linux hardening steps (UFW, SSH settings, file permissions)

**Skills:** system security and hardening.

---

MITRE ATT&CK Technique Walkthroughs
**Folder:** `/mitre-techniques`

Examples:
- T1059 - Command and Scripting Interpreter
- T1110 - Brute Force
- T1082 - System Information Discovery

Each includes:
- What the technique is
- How attackers use it
- How to detect it (SIEM queries)
- How to mitigate it

**Skills:** detection engineering fundamentals.

---

# Future Projects (Planned)
These are placeholders that will become full projects as I grow:

- Custom detection rules for Wazuh/Splunk
- Incident response mini-case studies
- Threat hunting exercises
- Malware analysis (safe environment only)
- Security automation with Python
