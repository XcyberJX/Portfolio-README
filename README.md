# About Me
I'm an aspiring SOC Analyst / Blue Team professional passionate about cybersecurity, threat detection, and digital defense.
This portfolio highlights the practical skills I am developing across:
- Log analysis
- SIEM monitoring (Splunk, Elastic, Wazuh)
- Incident response
- Network traffic analysis
- Threat Intelligence
- Detection engineering
- SOC playbooks and documantation

# Repository Structure
00-resources/      → Cheat sheets, learning roadmap, tool references  
01-notes/          → Notes on SOC fundamentals, threat intel, forensics  
02-labs/           → Hands-on exercises (Wireshark, logging, SIEM, IR, malware)  
03-projects/       → Detection rules, threat hunts, case studies, scripts  
04-playbooks/      → MITRE-mapped SOC playbooks  
05-reports/        → Incident reports, SOC daily summaries, vulnerability reports

Each folder contains detailed documentation, examples, and real-world scenarios reflecting the skills needed for a modem SOC environment.
